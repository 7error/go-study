## Go's Concurrency Building Blocks

### Goroutines

A `goroutine` is a function that is running concurrently (not necessarily in parallel!) alongside other functions (code). A `goroutine` is started by simply placing the `go` keyword before a function.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    go sayHello()
}

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("hello")
}
```

Anonymous functions can also be used to spawn `goroutines`.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("hello")
    }() // parentheses are necessary to create self-invoking anonymous functions
}
```

The above examples have a problem, it's undetermined if the `sayHello` portion will execute at all before the `main` goroutine exits. Once the `main goroutine` exits, all other `goroutines` scheduled or not will also terminate. The outcome of the example is unpredictable.

`Goroutines` are not `OS Threads`, and they're not exactly green threads (threads that are managed by a language's runtime) they're a higher level of abstraction known as `coroutines`. They're small `subroutines` (functions, closures, methods) that are non-preemptive, means they cannot be interrupted. They do however have multiple points which allow for suspension or reentry.

Go's runtime automatically observes the runtime behaviour of `goroutines` and automatically suspends them when they block and then resume when they become unblocked.

`Go's` mechanism for hosting goroutines is an implementation of what's called an M:N scheduler, which means it maps `M` green threads to `N` OS threads. Go follows a `fork-join` model of concurrency. This means that at any future point in the program it can split into separate branches. `Join` means that a some point, these branches come back together. Visual representation below. The `Go` keyword is what creates a fork, and the forked threads of execution are `goroutines`.

![fork join representation](/images/fork-join-goroutines.png)

In order to create a `join point` for the goroutines and the above `sayHello` example, the `goroutines` need to be `synchronized`. There are a few ways to do this, let's use the `sync` package for now. Here's a fixed version of the example.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Println("hello")
    }()
    wg.Wait() // join point
}
```

Understanding closures and `goroutines`.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for _, salutation := range []string{"hello", "greetings", "good day"} {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Println(salutation)
    }()
    }
    wg.Wait() // join point
}
```

When this program is run, the output is unexpectedly this...

```shell
good day
good day
good day
```

This is probably due to the loop exiting before the `Goroutines` have a chance to execute. Go is pretty observant and notices that `salutation` is still in use, moves this address to the heap to avoid a panic. Though the last member of the array is the one output three times.

The `idiomatic` way of writing this loop is to make a copy of salutation and pass that into the closure as an argument.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for _, salutation := range []string{"hello", "greetings", "good day"} {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(salutation string) {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Println(salutation)
    }()
    }
    wg.Wait(salutation) // join point
}
```

`Goroutines` are not garbage collected like other `go` types. Goroutines are also small, which means many of them can be run without fear of running out of memory. Lets find out the size of given goroutines.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	memConsumed := func() uint64 {
		runtime.GC()
		var s runtime.MemStats
		runtime.ReadMemStats(&s)
		return s.Sys
	}

	var c <-chan interface{}
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	noop := func() { wg.Done(); <-c } // goroutine that will never exit

	const numGoroutines = 1e4 // define number of goroutines to create
	wg.Add(numGoroutines)
	before := memConsumed() // measure memory consumed before creating goroutines
	for i := numGoroutines; i > 0; i-- {
		go noop()
	}
	wg.Wait()
	after := memConsumed() // measure memory consumed after creating goroutines
	fmt.Printf("%.3fkb", float64(after-before)/numGoroutines/1000)
}
```

## The sync Package

The `sync` package contains primitives that are most useful for low-level memory access synchronization.

### WaitGroup

The `WaitGroup` is a great way to wait for a set of concurrent operations to complete when you either don't care about the result of the concurrent operation, or you have other means of collecting their result. Here's a small example of using `WaitGroup` to wait for `goroutines` to complete.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(1) // add one goroutine to the counter
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done() // call Done using defer, when goroutine finishes, counter is decremented by 1
		fmt.Println("1st goroutine sleeping...")
		time.Sleep(1)
	}()

	wg.Add(1) // add one goroutine to the counter
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done() // call Done using defer, when goroutine finishes, counter is decremented by 1
		fmt.Println("2nd goroutine sleeping...")
		time.Sleep(2)
	}()

	wg.Wait() // wait blocks the main goroutine until all other goroutines complete
	fmt.Println("All goroutines complete.")
}
```

It's important that the calls to `Add` are done outside the `goroutines`, otherwise a race condition can be introduced. This is because there's no guarantee in the order of execution for these child goroutines.

### Mutex

A `Mutex` stands for `mutual exclusion` and it's a way to guard critical sections of a program. A critical part of a program is a piece of code that requires exclusive access to a *shared* resource. Sample of a program using `Mutex` to synchronize access to a a variable being incremented and decremented.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var count int
	var lock sync.Mutex

	increment := func() {
		lock.Lock()             // request exclusive use of the critical section, the count variable
		defer lock.Unlock()     // indicate done when access to the variable is complete
		count++
		fmt.Printf("Incrementing: %d\n", count)
	}

	decrement := func() {
		lock.Lock()             // request exclusive use of the critical section, the count variable
		defer lock.Unlock()     // indicate done when access to the variable is complete
		count--
		fmt.Printf("Decrementing: %d\n", count)
	}

	// Increment
	var arithmetic sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
		arithmetic.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer arithmetic.Done()
			increment()
		}()
	}

	// Decrement
	for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
		arithmetic.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer arithmetic.Done()
			decrement()
		}()
	}

	arithmetic.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Arithmetic complete.")
}
```

Critical sections are so named because they reflect a bottleneck in your program. It is somewhat expensive to enter and exit a critical section, and so generally people attempt to minimize the time spent in critical sections.

### RWMutex

The sync.RWMutex is conceptually the same thing as a Mutex: it guards access to memory; however, RWMutex gives you a little bit more control over the memory. You can request a lock for reading, in which case you will be granted access unless the lock is being held for writing. Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates a producer that is less active than the numerous consumers the code creates.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"os"
	"sync"
	"text/tabwriter"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	producer := func(wg *sync.WaitGroup, l sync.Locker) { // 1
		defer wg.Done()
		for i := 5; i > 0; i-- {
			l.Lock()
			l.Unlock()
			time.Sleep(1) // 2
		}
	}

	observer := func(wg *sync.WaitGroup, l sync.Locker) {
		defer wg.Done()
		l.Lock()
		defer l.Unlock()
	}

	test := func(count int, mutex, rwMutex sync.Locker) time.Duration {
		var wg sync.WaitGroup
		wg.Add(count + 1)
		beginTestTime := time.Now()
		go producer(&wg, mutex)
		for i := count; i > 0; i-- {
			go observer(&wg, rwMutex)
		}

		wg.Wait()
		return time.Since(beginTestTime)
	}

	tw := tabwriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout, 0, 1, 2, ' ', 0)
	defer tw.Flush()

	var m sync.RWMutex
	fmt.Fprintf(tw, "Readers\tRWMutex\tMutex\n")
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		count := int(math.Pow(2, float64(i)))
		fmt.Fprintf(
			tw,
			"%d\t%v\t%v\n",
			count,
			test(count, &m, m.RLocker()),
			test(count, &m, &m),
		)
	}
}
// 1: The producer function's second parameter is of the type sync.Locker.
//    This interface has two methods, Lock and Unlock, which the Mutex and RWMutex types satisfy.
//
// 2: Make the producer sleep for one second to make it less active than the observer goroutines.
```

### Cond

Is a rendezvous point for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence of an event. An `event` is any arbitrary signal between two or more goroutines that carries no information other than the fact that it has occurred. The `Cond` type allows a `goroutine` to sleep and wake up when it has things to do.

Bellow's an example of a `goroutine` that is waiting for a signal and a `goroutine` that is sending a signal.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	c := sync.NewCond(&sync.Mutex{}) // 1: create condition using standard sync.Mutex
	queue := make([]interface{}, 0, 10) // 2: create a slice with a length of zero and a capacity of 10

	removeFromQueue := func(delay time.Duration) {
		time.Sleep(delay)
		c.L.Lock() // 8: enter the critical section for the condition again to modify data
		queue = queue[1:] // 9: simulate dequeuing an item by reassigning the head of the slice to the second item
		fmt.Println("Removed from queue")
		c.L.Unlock() // 10: exit the condition's critical section
		c.Signal() // 11: let a goroutine in waiting know that something has occurred
	}

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		c.L.Lock() // 3: enter the critical section for the condition by calling Lock
		for len(queue) == 2 { // 4: check the length of the queue in the loop
			c.Wait() // 5: call Wait which will suspend the main goroutine until a signal on condition is seen
		}
		fmt.Println("Adding to queue")
		queue = append(queue, struct{}{})
		go removeFromQueue(1 * time.Second) // 6: create a new goroutine that will dequeue an element after one second
		c.L.Unlock() // 7: exit the condition's critical section
	}
}
```

## Once

`sync.Once` is a type that utilizes some `sync` primitives internally to ensure that only one call to `Do` ever calls the function passed in.

Example of a a function being called only once.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var count int

	increment := func() {
		count++
	}

	var once sync.Once

	var increments sync.WaitGroup
	increments.Add(100)
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		go func() {
			defer increments.Done()
			once.Do(increment) // sync.Once guarrantees that your function is only called once
		}()
	}

	increments.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("Count is %d\n", count)
}

// Output: 1
```

## Channels

Go `channels` are one of the primitives for `goroutine` synchronization. They can be used to synchronize access of memory, but are best suited to communicated information between goroutines. `Channels` serve as a conduit of information; values may be passed along the channel, and then read out downstream. `Channels` can be omnidirectional or unidirectional, meaning a channel can both receive and send data, or a channel can receive or send data. `Channels` are typed like any other `Go` type, can also hold the `interface{}` which means any type. Here's a simple channel example.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    stringStream := make(chan string) // declare an unbuffered channel of string
    go func() {
        stringStream <- "Hello channels!" // pass string data into the channel
    }()

    fmt.Println(<-stringStream) // read from the channel
}
```

`Channels` are meant to be blocking, meaning that any attempt to read from channel will wait until there's data to be read, and any attempt to write to a full channel will wait until the channel's been freed. This is why the previous example works without any `sync.Add` or `sync.Wait` or `sync.Mutex Lock`.

The `receive from <-` can also be used to receive two values, the data from the `channel` and the `ok` value to indicate success.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	stringStream := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		stringStream <- "Hello channels!"
	}()
	salutation, ok := <-stringStream
	fmt.Printf("(%v): %v", ok, salutation)
}
// Output: (true): Hello channels!
```

The second return value is a way for a read operation to indicate whether the read off the channel was a value generated by a write elsewhere in the process, or a default value generated from a closed channel. One can read from a `closed channel` as well.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	intStream := make(chan int)
	close(intStream)
	integer, ok := <-intStream // read from a closed stream
	fmt.Printf("(%v): %v", ok, integer)
}
// Output: (false): 0
```

One can `range over channels` as well, stopping once the channel is closed.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	intStream := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		defer close(intStream) // ensure that the channel is closed before we exit the goroutine
		for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
			intStream <- i
		}
	}()

	for integer := range intStream { // range over stream (channel)
		fmt.Printf("%v ", integer)
	}
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

Multiple `goroutines` can be unblocked at once by closing a `channel` that they depend on. A closed channel can be read from an unlimited amount of times, it's easier, cheaper and faster than writing N times.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	begin := make(chan interface{})
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(i int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			<-begin // the goroutine waits until it is told it can continue
			fmt.Printf("%v has begun\n", i)
		}(i)
	}

	fmt.Println("Unblocking goroutines...")
	close(begin) // close the channel, which unblocks all the goroutines at once
	wg.Wait()
}
```

We can also create buffered channels, which are channels that are given a capacity when theyâ€™re instantiated. This means that even if no reads are performed on the channel, a goroutine can still perform n writes, where n is the capacity of the buffered channel. Hereâ€™s how to declare and instantiate one:

```go
dataStream := make(chan interface{}, 4) // create buffered channel with capacity of 4
```

Concrete example of buffered channel to see what's going on.

```go
 package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var stdoutBuff bytes.Buffer // create an in-memory buffer to help mitigate the nondeterministic nature of the output
	defer stdoutBuff.WriteTo(os.Stdout) // ensure that the buffer is written out to stdout before the process exits

	intStream := make(chan int, 4) // create a buffered channel with a capacity of four (4)
	go func() {
		defer close(intStream)
		defer fmt.Fprintln(&stdoutBuff, "Producer Done.")
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			fmt.Fprintf(&stdoutBuff, "Sending: %d\n", i)
			intStream <- i
		}
	}()

	for integer := range intStream {
		fmt.Fprintf(&stdoutBuff, "Received %v.\n", integer)
	}
}
// Output:
// Sending: 0
// Sending: 1
// Sending: 2
// Sending: 3
// Sending: 4
// Producer Done.
// Received 0.
// Received 1.
// Received 2.
// Received 3.
// Received 4.
```

Reading or writing to `nil` channels (the default value) will create a `deadlock`. Trying to close a `nil` channel will create a `panic` condition.

This is a reference for what the defined behaviour of working with channels is.

![Reference of Channels defined behaviour](/images/channel-behaviour-table.png)

### Unbuffered vs Buffered Channels

The only difference between `buffered` and `unbuffered channels` is an unbuffered channel is always declared with a capacity of zero (0). The buffered channel is declared with a known capacity, and useful in cases where the number of writes is known beforehand. One must be careful to always shoot for a buffered channel as it can be a premature optimization technicque that can lead to missed `datalocks`.

### The select Statement

The `select` statement is the glue to bind channels together; it's how we're able to compose channels together in a program to form larger abstractions. The `select` statement is one of the most crucial aspects of a `Go` program that uses concurrency.

How do `select` statements work, here's a quick simple example.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()
	c := make(chan interface{})
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
		close(c) // close the channel after waiting five (5) seconds
	}()

	fmt.Println("Blocking on read...")
	select {
	case <-c: // attempt to read on the channel
		fmt.Printf("Unblocked %v later.\n", time.Since(start))
	}
}
// Output:
// Blocking on read...
// Unblocked 5s later.
```

It looks like a `switch` block, but that's about it, the statements are not evaluated sequentially and there's no fallthrough if no match is found. All `channels` reads and writes are considered simultaneously to see if any of them are ready. The above example doesn't really require a `select` statement, it will be expanded on.
